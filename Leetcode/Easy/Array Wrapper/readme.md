# 2695. Array Wrapper

Create a class ArrayWrapper that accepts an array of integers in it's constructor. This class should have two features:

- When two instances of this class are added together with the + operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.

- When the String() function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. For example, [1,2,3].
