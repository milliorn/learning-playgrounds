# A guide to closures in Rust

A closure is like an anonymous function. It can be called, like a function can be called. But it has a couple of dissimilarities with a function that make it suitable for use in situations where a function will be a poor fit. First, you can write it inline which makes the code very concise. And second, it can capture variables from outside its scope. This high level description might make you believe that closures are simple. But there's more to them than you might think. Don't worry though, in this post we will explore in detail about what closures are and when to use them.
